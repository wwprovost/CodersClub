# Coders' Club Application
This repository contains all of the source code for the Coders' Club application. It does not contain build artifacts, and it is not buildable. Someday it will get Mavenized, but until then this gives us a way to manage some of the content.
Java sources are *CodersClub/src*, and JSPs, JavaScript, and other resources are under *CodersClub/WebContent*.
The separate *CodersClubTest* tree holds JUnit tests, which are run with *CodersClub/src* on the class path.
