      <p>You can make a program do different things based on inputs or random results, with a <em>conditional</em> structure, using the keywords <strong>if</strong> and <strong>else</strong>. Use <strong>if</strong> and a logical test to make a bit of code run only if the test is passed. Logical tests are things like "does A equal 5?" or "is X greater than Y?" Notice that we use <strong>==</strong> to check if one number equals another -- not the single <strong>=</strong>. And use <strong>!=</strong> for "is not equal to."</p>
      <p class="language NCL JavaScript" >After an <strong>if</strong> and the test, you must use curly braces <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> around the code you want to run conditionally. The code inside the braces is known as a "block" of code. You can put things all on one line, or on separate lines -- whatever seems right to you.</p>
      <p class="language Python" >After an <strong>if</strong> and the test, you must include a colon <strong>:</strong>, and the "block" of code you want to run conditionally must go on the following line or lines. That line or all of those lines must be <em>indented</em> -- must start with some spaces or tabs -- in order to be controlled by the <strong>if</strong> statement.</p>
      <p>After an <strong>if</strong>, test, and the block of code, you may write an <strong>else</strong> and a different block, and this second block will be run only if the test turns out not to be true -- for example when A is 10, meaning that it is <em>not</em> greater than 10.</p>
