      <p class="language NCL JavaScript" >The modulus operator is also the gateway to finding a whole-number quotient when a number is not evenly divisible by another. The trick is to take the modulus as the remainder, subtract it, and then divide the remaining value, which now must be a multiple of the divisor.</p>
      <p class="language Python" >The modulus operator is also pairs up nicely with a whole-number quotient. Remember that, in Python, the <strong>/</strong> operator gives you the whole-number quotient, and loses the remainder.</p>
