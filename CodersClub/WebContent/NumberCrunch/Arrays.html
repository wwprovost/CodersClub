      <p>Another big, new idea: an <strong>array</strong> or <strong>list</strong> can hold multiple values, each of which has a numerical index. Then you can work with all of the values, one at a time in a loop.</p>
      <p>The example below creates an array of 7 numbers, and then sets each one of them to the high temperature for each day in a week. Then it loops over the data, and calculates the average temperature.</p>
      <p class="language NCL" >Note that, while NCL has arrays, they are clumsy to use. This might be a good time to switch over to using Python or JavaScript: as you'll see, they make arrays a lot easier.</p>
