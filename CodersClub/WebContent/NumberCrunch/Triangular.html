      <p class="language NCL" >Write a procedure that takes a number as a parameter, and that can determine whether it is a "triangular number." A triangular number is the sum of some series of numbers starting at 1. So 1 is a triangular number; 1 + 2 = 3 so 3 is triangular; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 so 6 is triangular; etc. Your procedure should either print that the number is triangular, <u>or</u> find the next-highest number that is, and print that.</p>
      <p class="language NCL" >Then, call your procedure a few times, with triangular and non-triangular numbers -- try 6 (yes), 10 (yes), 20 (no, but 21 is triangular), etc.</p>
