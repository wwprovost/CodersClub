      <p>Now, can you modify your program, so that rather than generating one random hand, it loops through all possible hands? This is a nesting of 5 loops, each from 1 to 6. For each possible hand, analyze it, and count how many of each type of hand can occur. And of course you'll use a lot of your code from the previous challenge for this.</p>
      <p>When you've counted it all up, you can divide each count by the total possible hands (which is 6 to the 5th power, or 7776) to get a probability. Multiply that by 100 and you have a percentage. Print the results!</p>
