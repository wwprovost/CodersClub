      <p>You may be familiar with the Fibonacci sequence: we start with the number one, twice. Then, each number after that is the sum of the prevous two numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on.</p>
      <p>Can you write a program that produces the first ten numbers in the Fibonacci sequence? Naturally, you'll need to write a loop. The tricky part is managing the numbers: the current one, but also the previous two. You'll need a few variables, and to assign values from one to the other as you go ... give it a try! Once you get it working .. if 1 and 1 are the first and second numbers in the sequence, what is the 60th number in the sequence?</p>
