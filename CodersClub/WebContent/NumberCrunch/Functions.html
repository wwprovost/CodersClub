      <p>So far, our procedures can take input from the caller, but their only output is by printing results. It can be very useful to return a result to the caller ...</p>
      <p class="language NCL" >A procedure that can return a value is often known as a <strong>function</strong>. NCL has functions, but we still use the keyword <strong>procedure</strong>; the only real difference is that a procedure can use the <strong>return</strong> statement to return a computed value or result.</p>
      <p class="language Python" >A procedure that can return a value is often known as a <strong>function</strong>. In Python, procedures are just functions that don't return anything; and a function can use the <strong>return</strong> statement to return a computed value or result.</p>
      <p class="language JavaScript" >A procedure that can return a value is often known as a <strong>function</strong>. In JavaScript, procedures are just functions that don't return anything; and a function can use the <strong>return</strong> statement to return a computed value or result.</p>
      <p>You can call a function and expect the <strong>call</strong> itself to have a value. So you can set a variable to the results of the function call, and use it in the calling logic.</p>
