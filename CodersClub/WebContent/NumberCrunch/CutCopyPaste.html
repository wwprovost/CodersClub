      <p>When writing programs, it's often useful to be able to make copies of existing code, or to move pieces of the program around into a different order. The best ways to do this are to use the computer's "clipboard" with actions we call "cut," "copy," and "paste."</p>
      <p>To make copies of code, first copy it and then paste it. Try selecting the last two lines of the program shown here. Then, hold down the "command" button -- labeled <strong>&#8984;</strong> -- and press the <strong>C</strong> to copy those lines to the clipboard.</p>
      <p>Now position the caret at the bottom of the program, as if you were about to type more code there. Instead of typing, again hold down the <strong>&#8984;</strong> key and this time hit <strong>V</strong> to paste from the clipboard. Hit this key a few times, and you'll see multiple copies appear.</p>
      <p>If you want to remove a piece of code and paste it elsewhere, that's "cutting," and the magic key sequence there is <strong>&#8984;</strong> and <strong>X</strong></p>
