      <p>You can make some code run multple times, in a <em>loop</em>. There are a few ways to do this. We'll look first at repeating a fixed number of times.</p>
      <p class="language NCL" ><strong>repeat <em>N</em> times</strong> is followed by a block of code -- so, again, you must use curly braces -- and will execute that code the number of times you specify.</p>
      <p class="language Python" ><strong>for <em>var</em> in range(<em>N</em>):</strong> is followed by an indented line or block of lines, and will run that code the number of times you specify.</strong></p>
      <p class="language JavaScript" ><strong>for (let <em>var</em> = 0; <em>var></em> &lt; <em>N</em>; ++<em>var</em>)</strong> is followed by a block of code -- so, again, you must use curly braces -- and will execute that code the number of times you specify.</p>
      <p>This can be a powerful tool for repeating math operations. The middle part of the program below calculates the value of doubling the number 1, 10 times -- also known as two to the power of 10.</p>
      <p class="language NCL" >Or, sometimes it's useful to know which "iteration" of the loop you're in, and so you create a counter.</p>
      <p class="language Python JavaScript" >You can use the variable itself in the loop, too -- it's known as the <em>index</em> value. Notice that the count starts at <strong>zero</strong>, not one.</p>
