      <p>Now write a function <strong>bases_occupied</strong>. Just like <strong>runs_scored()</strong>, this will take a <strong>hits</strong> and a <strong>bases</strong> parameter. But this function will modify <strong>bases</strong> and return the updated list.</p>
      <p>You'll need to loop through the list of bases, and for each occupied base (value is True), "move" that runner ahead. A few tricks to this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some runners will move off the end of the list: those are the ones who cross home plate and score runs, and so we don't track them in this list anymore. In other words, they're no longer on base.</li>
        <li>You'll have an easier time if you work <strong>backwards</strong> from 3rd base to 1st. If you loop forwards, you might move a runner onto a base already occupied by another runner -- or move the same runner forward, over and over.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember to put the batter who got the hit on base, too.</p>
      <p>Un-comment the starter code to test your function.</p>

# You should see runners at all 3 bases:

# You should see runners at 1st and 2nd base:
#on_base = bases_occupied(1, [ True, False, True ])

# You should see a runner at 3rd:
#on_base = bases_occupied(3, [ True, False, True ])

# No runners at any bases after a home run:
#on_base = bases_occupied(4, [ False, True, False ])
