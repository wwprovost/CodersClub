      <p>Your simulation will rely on a few functions. First, create a <strong>runs_scored()</strong> function that takes a <strong>hits</strong> parameter and a <strong>bases</strong> parameter. The first is a hit (1-4 for single up through home run) and the second is a list of bases occupied (True or False for each of the three bases).</p>
      <p>The function should determine how many runs score on the given hit. Each base runner will advance a number of bases equal to the hit -- for example a runner on 1st goes to 3rd on a double, and a runner on 2nd would score a run. Return the number of runs scored -- and don't forget the batter! You don't need to change what bases are occupied; we'll do that in another function, later.</p>
      <p>Un-comment the given code to call your function and see how it handles each situation.</p>
