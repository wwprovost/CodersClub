      <p>To go beyond one row, you will need a way to keep track of what blocks are where: or, really what matters is the total length of the blocks on each row. That calls for a list of numbers -- each one representing the length of a row, with the "0" row being the bottom, "1" being above that, and so on. The list starts out empty, because there are no rows of blocks yet.</p>
      <p>This is a tricky algorithm! For each new block, check over each row, starting from the bottom (0) and going up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the block can fit on that row, place it at the end of the row, and add its size to the row length.</li>
        <li>If the block completes the row to a perfect 10. If so, remove that whole row from your list.</li>
        <li>If the block can't fit on the bottom row, try the next row up, until you're out of rows.</li>
        <li>If it doesn't fit in any row, create a new top row, and position the block at the left of that row. (This actually will happen on the first block of the game, since you'll start with no rows.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your completed program should be able to clear several rows as the game rolls on, and it may even seem to be able to go forever -- or, it may run into trouble after a while.</p>
