      <p>Copy your program from the previous level, and try it here. You will probably find that it starts to fail more quickly. There are fewer "ones" and "twos" in the mix of blocks now, which makes completing rows harder. You will also encounter "overhangs," where a row of, say, 7 blocks is covered by a row of 9 blocks. Now, neither row can be completed, and your logic will place blocks incorrectly so that they stack up in awkward structures, and the game ends quickly from there.</p>
      <p>You can improve your program to minimize overhangs: before placing a lock, double-check that the resulting row length would not be greater than the row below it. If it would overhang, don't place on that row: go up to the next one and keep looking.</p>
      <p>You'll get a taller, left-leaning structure, but you'll lasts longer and clear more rows.</p>
