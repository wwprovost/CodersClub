    Secret Coders' Club
  </h2>

  <p>Welcome to the <em>Secret</em> Coders' Club. In these activities, you'll learn a simple programming language that was created just for the purpose of &quot;encoding&quot; and &quot;decoding&quot; messages. Once you've learned the language, you'll be able to write programs that take ordinary text, like this ...</p>
  <blockquote>WELCOME TO THE CLUB</blockquote>
  <p>... and turn it into what looks like gibberish ...</p>
  <blockquote>QYFWIGY NI NBY WFOV</blockquote>
  <p>... but is really an encoded version of the original message. And, with another program, you'll be able to decode the message again.</p>
  <p>You'll also have the option of working with popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript.</p>
