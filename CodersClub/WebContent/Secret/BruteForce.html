      <p>What if you want to decode a message, but you don't know how it was encoded? There is a way to solve this sort of problem with a computer, and that is to try every possible option, until you crack the code. This approach is known as using the "brute force" of the computer.</p>
      <p>With the shift ciphers we're doing so far, how many possible codes are there? Note that shifting by 26 is really not shifting at all, and shifting by 27 is the same as shifting by 1.</p>
      <p>SO ... can you enhance your program so that it takes a starter string, and tries all 25 possible shifts, printing each one? Then you can inspect the results and see that one of the messages, hopefully, makes sense.</p>
      <p class="language SCCL" >SCCL doesn't have a direct way to loop over a range of numbers -- such as 1 through 25. But, it has "for each letter", and it has "code for" ... which means that if you loop over a string of letters, you can get the different code for each letter, and then use that number any way you like.</p>
