      <p class="language SCCL" >In SCCL, you can loop through all the letters in a string with &quot;for each letter <em>variable</em> in <em>string</em>&quot;. This statement defines a variable -- such as <strong>ltr</strong> in the code shown here -- and sets its value to each letter in the given string, one at a time, and for each of those values it runs the code  that follows.</p>
      <p class="language Python" >In Python, you can loop through all the letters of a string with <strong>for <em>variable</em> in <em>string</em></strong>. This statement defines a variable -- such as <strong>ltr</strong> in the code shown here -- and sets its value to each letter in the given string, one at a time, and for each of those values it runs the code  that follows.</p>
      <p class="language JavaScript" >In JavaScript, you can loop through all the letters of a string with <strong>for (let <em>variable</em> of <em>string</em>)</strong>. This statement defines a variable -- such as <strong>ltr</strong> in the code shown here -- and sets its value to each letter in the given string, one at a time, and for each of those values it runs the code  that follows.</p>
      <p class="language SCCL JavaScript" >After a loop statement, you must use curly braces <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> around the code you want to run for each letter. The code inside the braces is known as a "block" of code. You can put things all on one line, or on separate lines -- whatever seems right to you.</p>
      <p class="language Python" >After a loop statement, you must include a colon <strong>:</strong>, and the "block" of code you want to run for each letter must go on the following line or lines. That line or all of those lines must be <em>indented</em> -- must start with some spaces or tabs -- in order to be controlled by the loop.</p>
