      <p>O-KAY. Now we have the tools to do some interesting secret codes. Take a look at the program below. It builds a new string by adding one to the code for each of three letters, and then converting back to a letter.</p>
      <p>Hiding the real meaning of a text by replacing one letter with another is a simple sort of code, known as a <em>cipher</em>; and when a letter is always replaced by a letter that's some number of letters earlier or later in the alphabet, as it is here, it's called a <em>shift cipher</em>.</p>
      <p>So the code on this page is shifting each of the original letters by one and converting back. Pretty good ... but why are we working so hard, translating each letter with separate lines of code? What we really need is a loop ...</p>
