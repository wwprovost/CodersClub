      <p>Here's another challenge: see that we've declared four variables at the top of the program? And then we define a variable <strong>name</strong>, and at the bottom we print out the lyrics to a song, using that variable in two places.</p>
      <p>Run the program to see the output -- which is definitely not right. Now, change the line in the middle of the program, and add more lines right after that, so that by the time you print the song lyric, it's correct, with the full name "John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt" where it should be.</p>
